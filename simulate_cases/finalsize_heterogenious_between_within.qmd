This scenario assumes that, in the population, there is: 

- Heterogeneous social contact
- Different susceptibility to the infection:

  - Between individuals of different age groups from 20% (infants) to 100% (65+), and
  - Within individuals of the same age group due the immunization effect of 25%.

- The immunization uptake rate is also different for each of the age groups: immunization increases with age from 20% (infants) to 90% (65+)

```{r}
library(finalsize)
library(socialmixr)
library(tidyverse)

# get UK polymod data
polymod <- socialmixr::polymod
contact_data <- socialmixr::contact_matrix(
  polymod,
  countries = "United Kingdom",
  age.limits = c(0, 5, 18, 40, 65),
  symmetric = TRUE
)

# get the contact matrix and demography data
contact_matrix <- t(contact_data$matrix)

# scale the contact matrix so the largest eigenvalue is 1.0
# this is to ensure that the overall epidemic dynamics correctly reflect
# the assumed value of R0
contact_matrix_scaled <- contact_matrix / max(Re(eigen(contact_matrix)$values))

# Define population in each age group
demography_vector <- contact_data$demography$population
demography_groups <- contact_data$demography$age.group

demography_vector
demography_groups

# divide each row of the contact matrix by the corresponding demography
# this reflects the assumption that each individual in group {j} make contacts
# at random with individuals in group {i}
contact_matrix_random <- contact_matrix_scaled / demography_vector


# Set and immunization effect
immunization_effect <- 0.25

# susceptibility matrix
susceptibility <- tibble(
  age_group = demography_groups,
  unimmunised = c(0.2, 0.5, 0.6, 0.9, 1.0)
) %>%
  mutate(immunised = unimmunised * (1 - immunization_effect)) %>%
  column_to_rownames(var = "age_group") %>%
  as.matrix()

susceptibility

# demography-in-susceptibility matrix
p_susceptibility <- tibble(
  age_group = demography_groups,
  immunised = c(0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0.9)
) %>%
  mutate(unimmunised = 1 - immunised) %>%
  column_to_rownames(var = "age_group") %>%
  as.matrix()

p_susceptibility

# R0 of the disease
r0 <- 1.5 # assumed for pandemic influenza

# Calculate the proportion of individuals infected in each age group
final_size(
  r0 = r0,
  contact_matrix = contact_matrix_random,
  demography_vector = demography_vector,
  susceptibility = susceptibility,
  p_susceptibility = p_susceptibility
)
```
