## Ingredients

- Nouns

## Steps in code

```{r}
#| warning: false

# Load required packages
library(tidyverse)

# Define the immunization effect
immunization_effect <- 0.25

# Read the immunization effect
immunization_effect
```

## Steps in detail

<!-- reduce length of strings with a large language model like chatgpt -->

- `tidyverse` package is loaded to manage data frame objects.

<!-- must: keep to warn users on how to install packages -->

Please note that the code assumes the necessary packages are already installed. If they are not, you can install them using first the `install.packages("pak")` function and then the `pak::pak()` function for both packages in CRAN or GitHub before loading them with `library()`. 

<!-- optional: erase if no assumed distribution is needed -->

Additionally, make sure to adjust the serial interval distribution parameters according to the specific outbreak you are analyzing.
