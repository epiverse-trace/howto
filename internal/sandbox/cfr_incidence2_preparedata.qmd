## Steps in code

```{r}
#| warning: false

library(incidence2)
library(cfr)
library(tidyverse)

# Load covid outbreak data
ts_covid_uk <- 
  incidence2::covidregionaldataUK %>% 
  filter(date <= "2020-12-31")

# Create {cfr} input data from time-series data
ts_covid_uk_cfr_input <- 
  
  # Create a incidence2 object
  # use two variables in counts argument
  incidence2::incidence(
    x = ts_covid_uk, 
    counts = c("cases_new","deaths_new"),
    date_index = "date"
  ) %>% 
  
  # Prepare incidence2 object to {cfr} input data
  cfr::prepare_data(
    cases_variable = "cases_new",
    deaths_variable = "deaths_new",
    fill_NA = TRUE
  )

# Read {cfr} input data
# ts_covid_uk_cfr_input

# Estimate naive case fatality ratio
cfr::estimate_static(data = ts_covid_uk_cfr_input)
#>   severity_me severity_lo severity_hi
#> 1  0.02885153  0.02870385  0.02899978

## Steps in detail

<!-- reduce length of strings with a large language model like chatgpt -->

- `tidyverse` package is loaded to manage data frame objects.

<!-- must: keep to warn users on how to install packages -->

Please note that the code assumes the necessary packages are already installed. If they are not, you can install them using first the `install.packages("pak")` function and then the `pak::pak()` function for both packages in CRAN or GitHub before loading them with `library()`. 

<!-- optional: erase if no assumed distribution is needed -->

Additionally, make sure to adjust the serial interval distribution parameters according to the specific outbreak you are analyzing.
