## What will you learn?

-   You will learn how to complete a specific outbreak analytic task following concrete steps to solve a real-world problem.

## Who are these for?

In the creation of these materials, we though in:

-   [Juan](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/personas/juan-datero.html), a Data Analyst and R user in a National Health Agency with constant deployment to outbreak response.
-   Celina, a Post-doc and fluent R user who needs to keep up-to-date with the latest package developments.
-   Daniel, a Trainer that wants to remix content to create specific training materials for public health practitioners.

## Design Principles

- Provide a ["How-to" guides](https://documentation.divio.com/how-to-guides/) as single point solutions to specific problems.
- Add links to related [Explanation](https://documentation.divio.com/explanation/) documentation.
- Leverage the ecosystem: Facilitate the Accessibility to the Outbreak analytics ecosystem by using the Tidyverse. This provides a consistent and smoother learning experience to users. Aligned with the [datasciencebox design principles](https://datasciencebox.org/01-design-principles.html#leverage-the-ecosystem) and [FAIR principles for software ecosystems](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.15409).
- Show the context (part of the pipeline), ingredients (packages) and steps.
- Add brief interpretation templates.
- Functions, as in package websites, should have [code-link](https://downlit.r-lib.org/) to their [Reference](https://documentation.divio.com/reference/) documentation.
- Provide a "search by keyword" to find what a user needs.
-   Show the `R` code needed to solve Outbreak Analytics [tasks](index.qmd).
-   Show how [Epidemiology `R` packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Epidemiology.html) are integrated in [pipelines](index.qmd).
-   Help to identify which coding task can be replaced by new `R` packages.
-   Provide various infectious disease scenarios by world regions and data sources.
-   Refer to external learning resources.
-   Refer to a glossary of terms.
-   Refer to good coding practices.

## Reproducibility

-   Non-invasive package management with [`{renv}`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/)
