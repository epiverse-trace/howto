Conditions: 

- Calculate the weekly growth rate.
- Use the date of onset of symptoms.
- Keep the first 20 weeks as period of analysis.

```{r}
#| warning: false

# Calculate the weekly growth rate of an outbreak

# Load required packages
library(outbreaks)
library(incidence2)
library(i2extras)
library(dplyr)

# Load the simulated Ebola outbreak data
data(ebola_sim_clean)

# Extract the first element of the list
linelist <- ebola_sim_clean$linelist

# Convert the data to an incidence2 object
incidence2_data <- 
  incidence2::incidence(
    x = linelist, 
    date_index = "date_of_onset",
    interval = "week"
  )

# Filter the dataset to keep the first 20 weeks. 
incidence2_filter <- incidence2_data[1:20,]

# Model the incidence
incidence2_fit <- 
  i2extras::fit_curve(
    incidence2_filter, 
    model = "poisson", 
    alpha = 0.05
  )

# Print the model result
i2extras::growth_rate(incidence2_fit)

# Plot the model result with prediction intervals
plot(incidence2_fit, ci = FALSE, pi = TRUE)

# Read plot documentation for an incidence2_fit object
# ?plot.incidence2_fit
```

- The `outbreaks` package is loaded to access the simulated Ebola outbreak data.
- The `ebola_sim_clean` object from the package contains the simulated outbreak data.
- The `linelist` object contains the first list element from `ebola_sim_clean`.
- The `incidence()` function from the `incidence2` package converts the data object `linelist` to an `incidence2` class object.
- The `date_of_onset` column is used in the `date_index` argument as the onset dates of the outbreak.
- The `"week"` text string is used to count number of cases per week interval to calculate the weekly growth rate.  
- The `incidence2` object provides observations arranged in descendant order with respect to the `date_index`.
- The number of weeks to consider is set to 20 and stored in the `dat_filter` object.
- The `fit_curve()` function from the `i2extras` package fits a Poisson linear regression model to the epicurve in the `dat_filter` object with an alpha value of `0.05` to calculate the 95% confidence intervals.
- The `growth_rate()` function calculate the weekly growth/decay rate.
- The `plot()` function plot the fitted epicurve.

Please note that the code assumes the necessary packages are already installed. If they are not, you can install them using first the `install.packages("pak")` function and then the `pak::pak()` function for both packages in CRAN or GitHub before loading them with `library()`. 

Additionally, make sure to adjust the serial interval distribution parameters according to the specific outbreak you are analyzing.
